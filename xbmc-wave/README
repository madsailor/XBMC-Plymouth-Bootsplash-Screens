Code Notes
==========
Try changing the script to make a new theme...it's easy!  Open the .script file with a text editor (like notepad++ on Windows, TextWrangler on Mac or Gedit on Linux).  The code is now commented to help guide you through what's going on. Make your changes, then make a few small changes in the .plymouth file to point to your new script, and you have your own customized theme.

If you are running on a linux system that uses the plymouth bootloader you can check the progress of your changes by running this command in a terminal:  
sudo plymouthd; sudo plymouth --show-splash ; for ((I=0; I<10; I++)); do sudo plymouth --update=test$I ; sleep 1; done; sudo plymouth quit
