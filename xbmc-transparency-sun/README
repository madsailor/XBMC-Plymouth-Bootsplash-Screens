code notes
==========

the "offset" variable is used to set the y position of the sun. 
0 would be center, positive values go down and negative to top of screen.
(all parts should use this offset)

if you scroll past the image/sprite definitions, you see some *.start and
*.end values. those say at which "progress-time" (from 0 to 1) that part
will be faded in. 

sunGlow also has .animStart/End "progress-time", to say when to move from
.startPos to .endPos on the screen
