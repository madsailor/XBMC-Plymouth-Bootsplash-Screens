Code Notes
==========

The "offset" variables are used to set the Y position of the 'media center' portion of the XBMC logo and belt. Y-up = smaller values, Y-down = larger values.

The # variable in lines like 'b_scale = (win_height / (b_height * 6));' is a divisor of the vertical screen resolution. In this example the input graphic is scaled to be 1/6 of the screens vertical resolution. 

If you scroll past the image/sprite definitions, you see some lines with *.animStart/End "progress-time".  These define when to move from .startPos to .endPos on the screen.

If you want to fade in graphics at a certain time you may add some *.Start and
*.End values (from 0 to 1) that will be recognized. ex: 'bLogo.Start = 0.5; bLogo.End = 1;'
